## The E-Visa Landscape in 2026

Vietnam's e-visa program has become the go-to entry option for most expats. But the rules have evolved since the program expanded in 2023, and there are a few things you need to know before applying.

## Key Changes

**Duration:** E-visas now allow stays of up to 90 days with single or multiple entry options. This is a significant improvement from the original 30-day limit.

**Application process:** Still fully online at [evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn](https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn). Processing takes about 3 business days.

**Cost:** $25 USD government fee, paid online.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Applying too late** — Apply at least 7 days before travel. Processing is usually 3 days but can take longer during peak periods.

2. **Photo requirements** — The photo must be exactly 4x6 cm, white background, without glasses. Many applications are rejected for photo issues.

3. **Passport validity** — Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from your entry date.

4. **Entry point mismatch** — Make sure the port of entry on your application matches where you'll actually enter Vietnam.

## When an E-Visa Isn't Enough

If you plan to work, start a business, or stay longer than 90 days, you'll need a different visa category. Check our [complete visa guide](/visa) for all your options.
