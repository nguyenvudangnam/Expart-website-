  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Building a family life in Vietnam as an expat involves navigating a system that wasn't designed with foreigners in mind. Marriage registration, dependent visas, birth certificates — each process has its own requirements and surprises.
  </p>
  <p>
    This guide covers the most common family legal situations expats face, with practical steps and real expectations on timelines and costs.
  </p>

  <h2 id="marriage-registration">Marriage Registration</h2>

  <h3 id="marrying-vietnamese">Marrying a Vietnamese Citizen</h3>
  <p>
    This is the more complex path and requires dealing with the Department of Justice (So Tu phap). The process involves:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Certificate of No Impediment</strong> — Issued by your embassy/consulate in Vietnam, proving you're legally free to marry.</li>
    <li><strong>Health certificate</strong> — From a Vietnamese-approved medical facility.</li>
    <li><strong>Document authentication</strong> — All foreign documents must be consularized/apostilled and translated into Vietnamese by a certified translator.</li>
    <li><strong>Application submission</strong> — Submit at the Department of Justice where the Vietnamese spouse is registered.</li>
    <li><strong>Interview</strong> — Both parties may be interviewed separately to verify the relationship.</li>
    <li><strong>Marriage certificate</strong> — Issued within 25 working days of complete application.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Timeline reality:</strong> Budget 2-3 months from start to marriage certificate, accounting for document gathering and processing delays.
  </p>

  <h3 id="between-foreigners">Marriage Between Foreigners</h3>
  <p>
    Two foreigners can marry in Vietnam, but it's less straightforward. Some embassies perform consular marriages; others require you to register in one partner's home country. Check with both embassies first.
  </p>

  <h2 id="birth-registration">Birth Registration</h2>
  <p>
    When a child is born in Vietnam to at least one foreign parent:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hospital birth certificate</strong> — Issued at the hospital within 24 hours.</li>
    <li><strong>Civil registration</strong> — Register at the commune/district People's Committee within 60 days. This produces the official Vietnamese birth certificate.</li>
    <li><strong>Home country registration</strong> — Report the birth to your embassy to get citizenship and a passport for your child.</li>
    <li><strong>Important:</strong> Vietnam does NOT grant citizenship by birth on Vietnamese soil. The child's citizenship follows the parents' nationality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="dependent-visas">Dependent Visas for Family</h2>
  <p>
    If you have a work permit or investor visa, your spouse and children can obtain TT (dependent) visas:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Matches the sponsor's visa/work permit validity</li>
    <li><strong>Required:</strong> Proof of relationship (marriage certificate, birth certificate) — translated and notarized</li>
    <li><strong>Work rights:</strong> Dependents need their own work permit to work legally</li>
    <li><strong>School:</strong> Dependent visa is usually required for international school enrollment</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="school-enrollment">International School Enrollment</h2>
  <p>
    Vietnam has a growing international school market in HCMC and Hanoi. Most require:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Valid passport and visa for the child</li>
    <li>Previous school transcripts (translated if needed)</li>
    <li>Health/vaccination records</li>
    <li>Application fee ($100-$500) and enrollment deposit</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Cost range:</strong> $5,000-$30,000+ per year depending on the school. Top-tier schools (BIS, ISHCMC, Concordia) have waitlists — apply early.
  </p>

  <h2 id="household-registration">Household Registration</h2>
  <p>
    Vietnam's household registration system (so ho khau) has been reformed, but it still affects certain administrative processes. Foreigners cannot obtain a ho khau, but your Vietnamese spouse can, and this can simplify various registrations and property purchases.
  </p>

  <h2 id="divorce-custody">Divorce & Custody</h2>
  <p>
    Divorce involving a foreign spouse falls under Vietnamese courts if the marriage was registered in Vietnam. Key points:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mutual consent divorce:</strong> Handled at the district People's Court. Faster if both parties agree on terms.</li>
    <li><strong>Contested divorce:</strong> Can be lengthy — 6-12+ months through the court system.</li>
    <li><strong>Child custody:</strong> Vietnamese courts generally favor the mother for young children, but each case is evaluated individually.</li>
    <li><strong>Property division:</strong> Vietnamese law applies to property acquired during the marriage in Vietnam.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Critical:</strong> Divorce and custody matters involving cross-border elements are among the most complex legal situations an expat can face. Professional guidance is strongly recommended.
  </p>

  <h2 id="when-to-get-help">When to Get Professional Help</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You're planning to marry a Vietnamese citizen and need to understand the process</li>
    <li>You need dependent visas for your spouse and/or children</li>
    <li>You're registering a birth and unsure about dual citizenship implications</li>
    <li>You're facing divorce or custody issues with cross-border complications</li>
    <li>You need documents apostilled or authenticated for family matters</li>
  </ul>
