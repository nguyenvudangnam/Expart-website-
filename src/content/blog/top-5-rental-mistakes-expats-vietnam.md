## The Rental Minefield

Finding an apartment in Vietnam is exciting. Signing a bad lease is not. Here are the five most common — and most expensive — mistakes I see expats make.

## 1. Not Getting a Bilingual Contract

If your lease is only in Vietnamese, you're signing something you don't understand. Always request a bilingual (Vietnamese-English) contract. If the landlord refuses, that's a red flag.

## 2. Ignoring the Deposit Return Clause

The number one complaint from expat renters: not getting the deposit back. Your contract should clearly state:
- The conditions for full deposit return
- What counts as "damage" vs. "normal wear and tear"
- The timeline for return (typically 30 days after move-out)

## 3. Paying Above-Rate Electricity

Vietnamese law sets government electricity rates. Some landlords charge 4,000-5,000 VND per kWh when the government rate is around 2,000-3,500 VND. This is technically illegal. Ask about electricity pricing before signing.

## 4. No Move-In Documentation

Take photos and video of everything on move-in day. Every scratch, every stain, every broken tile. Email them to your landlord with a timestamp. This is your insurance policy for getting the deposit back.

## 5. Skipping the Early Termination Clause

Life happens. Jobs change. Plans shift. If your contract doesn't have a reasonable early termination clause, you could lose your entire deposit for leaving early. Negotiate a fair penalty (typically 1-2 months' notice).

## The Bottom Line

A 60-minute [contract review consultation](/book) before signing can save you thousands of dollars and months of stress. Check out our [complete renting guide](/renting) for everything you need to know.
